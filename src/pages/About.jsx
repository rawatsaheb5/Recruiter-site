              Coursify's mission is to be a straightforward and productive hiring solution for retail, hospitality and x businesses. It's simple: we help build pipeline, and we help screen candidates for managers. We do it with a delightful interface and AI recruiting assistant who has time to get to all the things managers and recruiters can't.

                  <p>Hi! I'm originally from the SF Bay Area. I went to Georgetown University in DC for undergrad where I played Women's Golf and studied Classics. I then went to law school at Washington University in St. Louis where I became interested in employment law, which led me to explore careers in HR and Talent. I wanted to get into tech so I pursued opportunities in recruiting, starting at a firm (Riviera) then going in house to Instacart, Snapchat, and Uber between 2013-2019. I left to start Coursify!</p>

                  <p>I have the taste buds of a five-year-old, and I'm living proof that a self-professed dog person can indeed become a cat person.</p>

                  <p>Founding Engineer</p>
                  <p>Joined a team of friends to build a startup in the University, and learning to write code stuck with me ever since. I enjoy listening to podcasts, reading short articles, and the depth of stories in anime. Fun fact, I also create digital art and comics (learned to draw in 2019).</p>
